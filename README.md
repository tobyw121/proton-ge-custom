# GE-Proton

> [!Warning]
> **Running non-Steam games with GE-Proton outside of Steam is only supported using [umu](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher):**
> 
> Proton runs in a container, which uses a runtime environment and libraries specifically built for use within that container. Not running it as intended results in the container and therefore its runtime not being used, which severely breaks library compatibility. It causes Wine to attempt to search for libraries on your system instead of those it was built with or intended for use with Proton. It may work if enough libraries match, but it is not the expected environment and not supported due to library differences across Linux distributions.
> 
> If you want Proton functionality outside of Steam, umu-launcher is a command-line tool that was designed to be able to mimic Steam in running the entire containerized runtime environment it needs in order to run Proton exactly as Steam does without needing Steam. Any other method is not supported.
>
>[Heroic](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/) has also enabled umu by default when using `GE-Proton`.
>
>[Lutris](https://lutris.net/) has integrated umu as the default backend used when `GE-Proton (Latest)` is selected as a Wine runner either globally or for any specific game.

> [!Note]
> (1) Please note, this is a custom build of Proton, and is not affiliated with Valve's Proton.
> 
> (2) Please also note I will not assist with unofficial builds of GE-Proton. The only version of GE-Proton that I provide and will assist with builds of is the one provided within this repository, using the build system documented here.
> 
> (3) I cannot validate the accuracy or functionality of other builds that have not been built using the build system included here.

## Overview

This is my build of Proton with the most recent bleeding-edge Proton Experimental Wine.

Things it contains that Valve's Proton currently does not:

- Additional media foundation patches for better video playback support
- AMD FSR patches added directly to fullscreen hack that can be toggled with WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1
- FSR fake resolution patch details [here](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/pull/52)
- NVIDIA CUDA support for PhysX and NVAPI
- Raw input mouse support
- 'protonfixes' system -- this is an automated system that applies per-game fixes (such as winetricks changes, environment variables, Easy Anti-Cheat workarounds, overrides, etc)
- Various upstream Wine patches backported
- Various wine-staging patches applied as they become needed
- NTSync enablement if the kernel supports it.

## Notes

- Warframe is problematic with VSync. Turn it off or on in game, do not set to `Auto`
- Warframe should have a frame limit set in the game. An unlimited framerate may cause slowdowns
- Warframe on NVIDIA: you may need to disable GPU particles in game otherwise the game can freeze randomly. On AMD they should work fine.

Full patches can be viewed in [protonprep-valve-staging.sh](patches/protonprep-valve-staging.sh).

## Installation

You must have the proper Vulkan drivers and packages installed on your system. VKD3D on AMD requires Mesa 22.0.0 or higher for the VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering extension. Check [here](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.md) for general driver installation guidance.

### Manual

#### Via [`asdf`, the version manager](https://asdf-vm.com/)

There is an unofficial [plugin for installing and managing GE-Proton versions](https://github.com/augustobmoura/asdf-protonge)
with [`asdf` (the universal version manager)](https://asdf-vm.com/), it follows
the same process as the manual installation but makes it a lot easier. Managing
versions by removing and updating to newer versions also becomes easier.

To install by it first [install `asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html),
and then proceed to add the 'asdf-protonge' plugin and install the version you want.
``` bash
asdf plugin add protonge

# Or install a version from a tag
asdf install protonge latest
```

It's also possible to use the asdf plugin in Flatpak installations, by customizing the target `compatibilitytools.d` path. For more settings check the [plugin's official documentation](https://github.com/augustobmoura/asdf-protonge).

After every install you need to restart Steam, and [enable proton-ge-custom](#enabling).

#### Native

This section is for those that use the native version of Steam.

1. Download a release from the [Releases](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases) page.
2. Create a `~/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d` directory if it does not exist.
3. Extract the release tarball into `~/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/`.
   * `tar -xf GE-Proton*.tar.gz -C ~/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/`.
4. Restart Steam.
5. [Enable proton-ge-custom in Steam](#enabling).
  
    
*Get the latest release of GE-Proton through your terminal. It is assumed that you have all of the necessary software to use these commands installed:*
```bash
# Make a temporary working directory
echo "Creating temporary working directory..."
rm -rf /tmp/proton-ge-custom
mkdir /tmp/proton-ge-custom
cd /tmp/proton-ge-custom

# Download the tarball for the latest release
echo "Fetching tarball URL..."
tarball_url=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | cut -d\" -f4 | grep .tar.gz)
tarball_name=$(basename $tarball_url)
echo "Downloading tarball: $tarball_name..."
curl -# -L $tarball_url -o $tarball_name --no-progress-meter

# Download the checksum for the latest release
echo "Fetching checksum URL..."
checksum_url=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | cut -d\" -f4 | grep .sha512sum)
checksum_name=$(basename $checksum_url)
echo "Downloading checksum: $checksum_name..."
curl -# -L $checksum_url -o $checksum_name --no-progress-meter

# Verify the downloaded tarball with the downloaded checksum
echo "Verifying tarball $tarball_name with checksum $checksum_name..."
sha512sum -c $checksum_name
# If result the verification succeeds, continue

# Make a Steam compatibility tools folder if it does not exist
echo "Creating a Steam compatibility tools folder if it does not exist..."
mkdir -p ~/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d

# Extract the GE-Proton tarball to the Steam compatibility tools folder
echo "Extracting $tarball_name to the Steam compatibility tools folder..."
tar -xf $tarball_name -C ~/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/
echo "Done"
```

The shell commands above can be run as a script by pasting the commands in a file and adding the following to the top of the file assuming you have 'bash' installed:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
```

Save the file and make the script executable by adding the executable bit:
```bash
chmod +x file.sh
```

#### Flatpak

This section is for those that use the Steam Flatpak.

##### Flathub

The Steam Flatpak and [the unofficial build of GE-Proton provided by Flathub](https://github.com/flathub/com.valvesoftware.Steam.CompatibilityTool.Proton-GE) are not supported by GloriousEggroll nor Valve and were not tested with all possible games and cases. They can behave differently from the upstream builds. Use at your own risk.

1. [Add the Flathub repository](https://flatpak.org/setup/).
2. Run:
	```bash
	flatpak install com.valvesoftware.Steam.CompatibilityTool.Proton-GE
	```
3. [Enable proton-ge-custom in Steam](#enabling).

##### Manual

1. Download a release from the [Releases](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases) page.
2. Create a Steam compatibility tools directory at `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/` if it does not exist.
3. Extract the release tarball into `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/`.
   * `tar -xf GE-ProtonVERSION.tar.gz -C ~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/`
4. Restart Steam.
5. [Enable proton-ge-custom in Steam](#enabling).   

*Get the latest GE-Proton release through your terminal. It is assumed that you have all of the necessary software to use these commands installed:*

tarball_url=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | cut -d\" -f4 | grep .tar.gz)
tarball_name=$(basename $tarball_url)
echo "Downloading tarball: $tarball_name..."
curl -# -L $tarball_url -o $tarball_name --no-progress-meter

# Download the checksum for the latest release 
echo "Fetching checksum URL..."
checksum_url=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | cut -d\" -f4 | grep .sha512sum)
checksum_name=$(basename $checksum_url)
echo "Downloading checksum: $checksum_name..."
curl -# -L $checksum_url -o $checksum_name --no-progress-meter

mkdir -p ~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/compatibilitytools.d

# Extract the GE-Proton tarball to the Steam compatibility tools folder
echo "Extracting $tarball_name to the Steam compatibility tools folder..."
tar -xf $tarball_name -C ~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/
echo "All done :)"
```
The shell commands above can be run as a script by pasting the commands in a file and adding the following to the top of the file assuming you have 'bash' installed:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
```

Save the file and make the script executable by adding the executable bit:
```bash
chmod +x file.sh
```

#### Snap

This section is for those that use the Steam [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/steam).

This unofficial build isn't supported by GloriousEggroll nor Valve and wasn't tested with all possible games and cases. It can behave differently from the upstream builds. Use at your own risk.

##### Manual

1. Download a release from the [Releases](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases) page.
2. Create a `~/snap/steam/common/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/` directory if it does not exist.
3. Extract the release tarball into `~/snap/steam/common/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/`.
   * `tar -xf GE-ProtonVERSION.tar.gz -C ~/snap/steam/common/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/`
4. Restart Steam.
5. [Enable proton-ge-custom in Steam](#enabling).

## Building

1. Clone this repository by executing:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gloriouseggroll/proton-ge-custom
```

2. Drop any custom patches into patches/, then open patches/protonprep-valve-staging.sh and add a patch line for them under `#WINE CUSTOM PATCHES` in the same way the others are done.

3. Apply all of the patches in patches/ by running:

```sh
./patches/protonprep-valve-staging.sh &> patchlog.txt
```

in the main proton-ge-custom directory. Open `patchlog.txt` and search for "fail" to make sure no patch failures occured. An easy way to do this is like so:

```sh
grep -i fail patchlog.txt
grep -i error patchlog.txt 
```

4. Navigate to the parent directory containing the proton-ge-custom folder.

5. Type the following:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
../configure.sh --build-name=SOME-BUILD-NAME-HERE
make redist &> log
```

The build will be placed within the build directory as SOME-BUILD-NAME-HERE.tar.gz.

## Enabling

1. Right click any game in Steam and click `Properties`.
2. At the bottom of the `Compatibility` tab, Check `Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool`, then select the desired Proton version.
3. Launch the game.

## Options


###### Enable HDR

It should work if you have:

- A compositor with HDR support
- A game with HDR support.
- A monitor with HDR support.

```bash
PROTON_ENABLE_HDR=1 %command%
```

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling HDR auto-enables the wine-wayland driver as it is a requirement.
> As of right now, in-game Steam overlay WILL NOT work with Wayland enabled.
> Please also note that Steam Input also does not work properly with the wine-wayland driver due to the overlay being broken.

##### Enabling NTSync
For NTSync to work, your kernel must be version 6.14 or newer and built with `CONFIG_NTSYNC=y` or `CONFIG_NTSYNC=m`.
If using `CONFIG_NTSYNC=m`, a module loading configuration is required followed by a reboot:

/etc/modules-load.d/ntsync.conf
```
ntsync
```
You can also manually enable the module without reboot, just keep in mind the above configuration is needed for it to persist after reboots:
```
sudo modprobe ntsync
```


Environment variable options:

| Compat config string  | Environment Variable           | Description  |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------- |

|                       | <tt>PROTON_DUMP_DEBUG_COMMANDS</tt> | When running a game, Proton will write some useful debug scripts for that game into `$PROTON_DEBUG_DIR/proton_$USER/`. |
|                       | <tt>PROTON_DEBUG_DIR</tt>      | Root directory for the Proton debug scripts, `/tmp` by default. |
| <tt>wined3d</tt>      | <tt>PROTON_USE_WINED3D</tt>    | Use OpenGL-based wined3d instead of Vulkan-based DXVK for d3d11 and d3d10. This used to be called `PROTON_USE_WINED3D11`, which is now an alias for this same option. |
| <tt>nod3d12</tt>      | <tt>PROTON_NO_D3D12</tt>       | Disables DX12. |
| <tt>nod3d11</tt>      | <tt>PROTON_NO_D3D11</tt>       | Disables DX11. |
| <tt>nod3d10</tt>      | <tt>PROTON_NO_D3D10</tt>       | Disables DX10. |
| <tt>nod3d9</tt>      | <tt>PROTON_NO_D3D9</tt>        | Disables DX9.  |
| <tt>noesync</tt>      | <tt>PROTON_NO_ESYNC</tt>       | Do not use eventfd-based in-process synchronization primitives. |
| <tt>nofsync</tt>      | <tt>PROTON_NO_FSYNC</tt>       | Do not use futex-based in-process synchronization primitives. (Automatically disabled on systems with no `FUTEX_WAIT_MULTIPLE` support.) |
| <tt>nontsync</tt>      | <tt>PROTON_NO_NTSYNC</tt>       | Do not use the ntsync kernel module for in-process synchronization primitives. |
| <tt>forcelgadd</tt>   | <tt>PROTON_FORCE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE</tt> | Force Wine to enable the LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE flag for all executables. |
| <tt>heapdelayfree</tt>| <tt>PROTON_HEAP_DELAY_FREE</tt>| Delay freeing some memory, to work around application use-after-free bugs. |
|                       | <tt>HOST_LC_ALL</tt>           | Set value to a locale to override all other system locale settings for a game.  This variable should be used instead of `LC_ALL`. |
| <tt>enablenvapi</tt>  | <tt>PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI</tt>   | Enable NVIDIA's NVAPI GPU support library. |
| <tt>noforcelgadd</tt> |                                | Disable forcelgadd. If both this and `forcelgadd` are set, enabled wins. |
| <tt>oldglstr</tt>     | <tt>PROTON_OLD_GL_STRING</tt>  | Set some driver overrides to limit the length of the GL extension string, for old games that crash on very long extension strings. |
| <tt>cmdlineappend:</tt>|                               | Append the string after the colon as an argument to the game command. May be specified more than once. Escape commas and backslashes with a backslash. |
| <tt>xalia or noxalia</tt>               | <tt>PROTON_USE_XALIA</tt>                 | Enable Xalia, a program that can add a gamepad UI for some keyboard/mouse interfaces, or set to 0 to disable. The default is to enable it dynamically based on window contents. |
| <tt>seccomp</tt>      | <tt>PROTON_USE_SECCOMP</tt>    | Enable seccomp-bpf filter to emulate native syscalls, required for some DRM protections to work. |
| <tt>nowritewatch</tt> | <tt>PROTON_NO_WRITE_WATCH</tt> | Disable support for memory write watches in ntdll. This should only be applied if you have verified that the game can operate without write watches. This can improves performance for some very specific games. |
|                       | <tt>WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR</tt>   | Enable AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), use in conjunction with `WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH`. Only works in Vulkan games (DXVK and VKD3D-Proton included). |
|                       | <tt>WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH</tt> | AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) strength, the default sharpening of 5 is enough without needing modification, but can be changed with 0-5 if wanted. 0 is the maximum sharpness, higher values mean less sharpening. 2 is the AMD recommended default and is set by GE-Proton by default. |
|                       | <tt>WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_CUSTOM_MODE</tt> | Set fake resolution of the screen. This can be useful in games that render in native resolution regardless of the selected resolution. Parameter `WIDTHxHEIGHT` |
|                       | <tt>WINE_DO_NOT_CREATE_DXGI_DEVICE_MANAGER</tt> | Set to 1 to enable. Required for video playback in some games to not be miscolored (usually tinted pink) |
|                       | <tt>COPYPREFIX</tt> | Set to 1 to enable. If -steamdeck is used on steam (or SteamDeck=1 is set), copies the game's prefix and shader cache from the game partition to the local steam steamapps folder. Logic is reversed if -steamdeck not enabled (or SteamDeck=0) |
| `fsr4`               | `PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE`          | Automatically download `amdxcffx64.dll` and upgrade games with FSR 3.1 to use FSR 4. Version to download can be specified by supplying it as a value, like so `PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE="4.0.1"`, instead of `1`. Downloads version `4.0.2` of the required DLL by default. This option also disables AMD Anti-Lag 2 currently due to various issues.                                                                                      |
| `fsr4hud`            | `PROTON_FSR4_INDICATOR`        | Enable the FSR4 watermark at the top left portion of the screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `fsr4rdna3`          | `PROTON_FSR4_RDNA3_UPGRADE`    | Identical to `PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE` but for RDNA3 GPUs. Enables some required compatibility options and downloads version `4.0.0` of the DLL by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `dlss`               | `PROTON_DLSS_UPGRADE`          | Automatically download and use newer versions of `nvngx_dlss(d\|g).dll` DLLs. Version to download can be specified by supplying it as a value, like so `PROTON_DLSS_UPGRADE="310.2"`, instead of `1`, to download version `310.2.1.0`. This option also sets `DXVK_NVAPI_DRS_SETTINGS` to use the latest preset. If you provide your own config for it through this environment variable, your configuration is going to be applied.. |

## Credits

The GE-Proton project contains some of my personal tweaks to Proton, but a large amount of the patches, rebases and fixes come from numerous people's projects. 

While I tend to get credited for my builds, a lot of the work that goes into it are from other people as well. I'd like to take some time to point a few of these people out of recognition. 

In future builds, I plan to make clearer and more informative Git commits, as well as attempt to give these people further crediting, as my README may not be sufficient in doing so.

### TKG (Etienne Juvigny)

- https://www.patreon.com/tkglitch
- https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git

I and many others owe TKG. In regards to both Wind and Proton. He has dedicated a lot of time (2+ years at least) to rebasing Wine and Proton patches, as well as making his own contributions. Before he came along, I did some rebasing work, and mainly only released things for Arch. These days he almost always beats me to rebasing, and it saves myself and others a **lot** of work.

### Guy1524 (Derek Lesho)

- https://github.com/Guy1524

Derek was responsible for the original raw input patches, as well as several various game fixes in the past, just to name a few: MK11, FFXV, MHW, Steep, AC Odyssey FS fix. He has also done a massive amount of work on Media Foundation/MFPlat, which should be hopefully working very soon.

### Joshie (Joshua Ashton)

- https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/d9vk

Joshua is the creator of D9VK and also a huge contributor of DXVK. He is also known for his recent DOOM Eternal WINE fixes and also many of the Vulkan tweaks and fixes used, such as FS hack interger scaling.

### doitsujin/ドイツ人 (Philip Rebohle)

- https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk

Philip is the creator of DXVK and a heavy contributor of VKD3D. He also put up a lot of my bug reporting for Warframe years ago when DXVK started.

### HansKristian/themaister (Hans-Kristian Arntzen)

- https://github.com/HansKristian-Work

Hans-Kristian is a heavy contributor of VKD3D and he also created a lot of WINE patches that allowed WoW to work.

### flibitijibibo (Ethan Lee)

- https://github.com/sponsors/flibitijibibo
- https://fna-xna.github.io/

Ethan is the creator of FAudio, and he also listened to my Warframe bug reports years ago.

### simmons-public (Chris Simmons)

- https://github.com/simons-public

Chris is the creator of the original 'protonfixes' project. The portions of 'protonfixes' I've imported are what allow customizations to be made to prefixes for various Proton games. Without 'protonfixes' many games would still be broken and/or require manual prefix modification.

### wine-staging maintainers

I also of course need to thank the wine-staging maintainers: Alistair Leslie-Hughes, Zebediah Figura and Paul Gofman

They have contributed many patches to staging, far beyond what I have done, as well as kept up with regular rebasing. A lot of times when bug reports come to me, if it has to do with staging I end up testing and relaying information to these guys in order to get issues resolved.

### Reporters

Additionally, a thank you is owed to Andrew Aeikum (aeikum), and kisak (kisak-valve) for regularly keeping me in the loop with Proton and fsync patches, as well as accepting pull requests I've made to fix Proton build system issues, or listening to bug reports on early Proton patches before they reach a Proton release.

### Patrons

And finally - to all of my patrons that have supported me, thank you so much. It's because of you that I've been able to keep this project going, getting bug fixes reported, getting Proton/Wine issues fixed, getting various hardware and/or game fixes handled, and so on. Thanks to you, I have been able to use the spare budget in order to both help support the other people that make my project possible, as well as get things necessary for testing such as new game releases or specific hardware that hits odd issues. It's had a huge effect not just for this project, but a large trickle down effect.

My wine-staging co-maintainers are often able to ask me for testing games, or testing on different hardware if they don't have access to it. This also trickles into both Proton bug reporting and Lutris bug reporting, as I'm able to provide bug testing and feedback and custom builds and upgrades to them as well. I'm also able to test driver related issues for things such as mesa and getting things reported + patched. This in turn leads to early patches for Mesa, the kernel, VKD3D, and other packages on my copr repositories as well. The trickle down effect is just one gigantic awesome rabbit hole for getting things fixed. Thank you once again.
